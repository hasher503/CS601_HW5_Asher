## Summary
This mini-project fetches JSON data from the degrees.json file using a REST API (hosted on Netlify) and dynamically updates the DOM with a table containing information on degree attainment when the "Get Degrees" button is clicked. Likewise, the "Clear Degrees" button removes the table from the DOM.
